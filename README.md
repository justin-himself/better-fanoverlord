This is a Docker container that uses IPMI to monitor and control the fans on a Dell EMC Poweredge server through the iDRAC using raw commands.  
This script will read the CPU temp sensor repetitively and then adjust the fan speed according to a user-defined function.  
The script is based on orlikoski's project [fanoverlord](https://github.com/orlikoski/fanoverlord). 

**Why not let BIOS manages the fan speed?**  

This script actually manages to achieve lower power-efficiency than the default dell bios does. With the power of user-defined function, you can cutomize fan speed in different scenarios.   

Also, in some models (like my R720xd) the bios actually functions incorrectly after plugin addtional PCI-E device such as a graphics card, see [this](https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R720-High-Fan-with-GPU/td-p/6223226), [this](https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/Dell-PowerEdge-T130-Fan-issue/td-p/4774859) and [this](https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/PowerEdge-T640-fan-full-speed-after-installing-graphic-card/td-p/5849479)

**What if the script fails?**

The script will give back the fan control to BIOS when force exit or malfunction.


### Configure iDRAC
 - [Set IP Address for iDRAC and ensure docker can communicate with it](https://docs.extrahop.com/current/configure-i-drac/)
 - [Enable IPMI in the iDRAC ](http://www.fucking-it.com/articles/dell-idrac/214-dell-idrac-configure-ipmi)

### Choose Your TEMP-SPEED Function

To make your fan speed adjustment as smooth as possible, you should choose a function that maps the relationship between CPU temperature and fan speed. The function is expected to have these features:

- Continous                     -       So the transition is smooth
- Monotonically increasing      -       So the temperature always converages

The default function is  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73123028/174479239-71d1a8d3-6518-4114-8d0f-60566024f360.png" width="20%" height="20%">, where s is fan speed and t is temperature.   
This function works well when temperature is between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, and provides relatively low power consumption in this range.
